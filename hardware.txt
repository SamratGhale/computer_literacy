Processor's programming model 
-->Ececutes binary bits around 8 bits to 256 bytes on the high end

Instructions
-->A sequence of bits understood by the processer to signal a certain action
->Copy Bytes (Mostly from the memory)
->Arthemetic
->Bit logic
->jump(Makeing decisions)


Registes
-->A small memory area in a processer
  ->Keeps tracks of the memory address of the next instruction
  ->Stores some data-> for adding
data->memory->registers->processer->registers->memory



ISA (instruction ser artictures)
-->Instructions that the processor can understand
-->x86(IA-32,x86-64)
-->ARM
-->MIPS
-->Motorola 68k

processer catch (Between memory and processer) also called SRAM(static ram)
