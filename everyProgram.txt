programming is about data analysis, data transformation and data generation
transforming data with logic and generating data with logic

every program must do output
1. write data to a file
2. send data over a network
3. send data to screen for display
4. send data to an audio device for a playback

most programs also do input
1. read data form a file
2. recive data over a network
3. receive data from a mouse, keyboard, or other human input device

data comes in different types:
1. numbers(integers, real numbers, et al)
2. strings(sequences of text characters)
3. booleans (true or false)
4. collections (values made up of multiple other values)


every programming language has 
1. built-in operations
2. variables
3. branching (if satatements)
4. looping (while/ for statements)
5. function (programmer defined operations)
6. ...what about input and output?


operations 
1. most languages have a few dozen operations, including arithmetic, logic, string joining/splitting, + more
2. take input values (usually two) and return an output value
3. most operation generate new values rather than mutable existing values
