What is Verilog?
- IEEE industry standard hardware Description Language(HDL)- used to describe a digital system.
- Use in both hardware simulation and sythesis

HDL
- Hardware defination language
- A text based programming language that is used to model a piece of hardware.

While modeling in HDL you can use two types of modeling:

Behaviour Modeling
- A component is described by it's input output response
- Only the functionality of the circuit, no structure
- Systhesis tools creates correst logic

inputs ->
if (shift_left) begin
  out[0]< = 5 0;
  for (j = 1; j< 8; j=j+1)
    out[j] < = 5 out[j-1];
end


Structural Modeling
- A component is described by interconnecting lower-level components/primitives
- Functionality and structure of the circuits
- Call out the specific hardware

Register Transfer Level (RTL)
- A type of behaviour modeling, for the purpose of synthesis
- Hardware is implied or infered
- Synthesizable

Systhesis:
- Translating the HDL to circuit and then optimizing the represented circuit, for exaple lookup table and flip flop of fpga

RTL Synthesis:
- Translating a RTL model of hardware into an optimized technology specific gate level implementation
